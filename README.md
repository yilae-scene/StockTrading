STOCK TRADING PLATFORM APP
  HOW IT WORKS IN SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
  - User wants to buy a stock
  - the User asks the Market for price
  - Market looks at the current price of the stock object
  - Transaction happens and User's cash balance and stock holidngs are updated.
    [THIS WILL HELP US IN CREATING A CLEAR SEPARATION OF CONCERNS BETWEEN OUR USERS, STOCK, AND MARKET CLASSES]

    WE WILL ALO BE ADDING THE GSON LIBRARY TO OUR PROJECT FROM GOOGLE USING THE CURRENT STABLE VERSION
- The plan with using GSON library is to save and load user data using GOOGLE's GSON.
- Using GSON makes even more sense when we know we setup our project to implement Maven.
- We will be adding adding dependencies to our pom.xml file.
